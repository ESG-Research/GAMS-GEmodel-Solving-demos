In the "ex-ante" study of economic policy, researchers can use the Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model to simulate and predict the effects of policies that will be implemented in the future, and find the optimal solution of the policy objective function according to the principle of social welfare maximization. In recent years, a growing body of literature adopting CGE to study environmental economic policies. Among them, Fischer and Fox 2012; Bohringer et al. 2015; Carbone and Rivers 2017, they used the CGE model to eveluate effect of carbon pricing policies and estimate potential emissions leakage.
